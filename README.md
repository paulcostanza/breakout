# breakout

**To Do list**
- change where the ball starts - I want user to shoot it from the paddle
- change bounce angle off of the paddle (maybe even speed?)
- press space bar to shoot ball from (hovering) center of the paddle
- add difficulty (easy or hard mode) to the options menu. 
- add a pause button
- edit user names to lowercase in the high score menu

#### Nov 23rd
Added a high score menu that saves user name and score in local storage. 

#### Nov 22nd
1. Create menu.js to store menu options. So far I have moved the *rules* and *user name* options. My main.js is starting to get way too messy :worried:

2. Added a feature where users can **enter name**. Right now there name will appear right above the game board. In the future, I hope to implement a high score feature that is saved in local storage.
